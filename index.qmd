Hi! My name is Cassie Chou, and I'm a first-year master's student in the ScM Biostatistics program at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I'm passionate about social justice, environmental health, advocacy and policy, and their intersections. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, playing board games, watching baseball, and hanging out with my dog, Buffy (pictured below)!
