Others, like Qatar, Singapore, and the UAE, have mostly low levels of annual per-capita CO2 emissions, with a few large (high-emissions) outliers."

    "text": "Summary\nAs we see in our figures, the USA, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the UK have had the highest total per-capita CO2 emissions since 1800. Among the top 15 countries with the highest total per-capita CO2 emissions, the distributions of these emissions over time vary. Countries like the USA, Belgium, Australia, and the UK have had relatively consistent, slowly growing per-capita emissions, while others like Kuwait, Brunei, Qatar, and Luxembourg show very low per-capita emissions until a spike (and thus some very high outlier years) in recent times. Further investigation may examine the causes of these spikes in order to reduce emissions and prevent them from occurring again. A limitation of this analysis is that it analyzes per-capita CO2 emissions; countries with lower per-capita emissions but higher populations may be contributing more to worldwide CO2 emissions than those listed in this analysis. Still, this analysis is helpful in identifying which countries are disproportionately contributing to global CO2 emissions. Further study of these countries may determine and identify actions in these countries that may prove beneficial."
